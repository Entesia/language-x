# language-x

## Synopsis

The language-x project provides a basis for creating a multi-lingual ASP.NET website using a database to store the text parts. The goal is to include all aspects of ASP.NET solution, like the translation for C# controllers, actions, enums, etc and html objects like dropdowns, radio buttons and validation.   

## Motivation

For one of our projects we wanted to store all the translation texts in a database rather than in resource files. During the project we came across various aspects of making all parts of the solution translatable. We want to share our experience and hopefully help others along the way.

## Installation

Pull the repo and ensure the database connection string in web.config fits your localdb path.
